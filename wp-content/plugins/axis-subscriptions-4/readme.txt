users. You can restrict access to premium content based on the membership level of the user. It is super simple.

Just create a plan, set the period and price and publish. Use the short code to publish it an page. That's it. You are ready to sell memberships in your WordPress website.

= Why did we create Axis Subscriptions =

There are so many membership plugins are out there for WordPress. We found many of them are complex to set up and work.
So we set out to create a simple solution that works without a lot of fuzz. Axis Subscriptions gives you exactly what you need in the simplest way.

= Quick Start Video Demo =

= Integrated with popular payment gateways =

Accept **PayPal payments** from your members. You can accept both recurring payments, one-time payments. Keep track of the transaction history, manage their payments, send reminders. Beautifully.

= PayPal Recurring Payments =

Accept **recurring payments with PayPal** easy and quick. Say, you want to charge $10 a month for a membership plan. When a user purchases, Axis Subscriptions creates recurring payment profile in PayPal and
makes sure that the member is billed $10 automatically every month. Neat and simple.

= Create as many plans as you want =

Create *unlimited subscription plans* (free, gold, silver, platinum, etc.). Plans are completely flexible. Even you can create a free forever plan.

**Plan Types**

*   Free Plan
*   Recurring
*   Recurring with Trial period
*   Non-Recurring
*   Non-Recurring with trial period

= Recurring plans =

You can create recurring plans, for which customers will be billed at periodic intervals. For instance, $10 every month. The customer will automatically be billed $10 every month.

= Non-recurring plans =

You can also create non-recurring plans. Say for example, $50 one-time for accessing premium content for just one month. In this case, customer will be charged just $50 once and he can
access your premium content for a month.

= Plans with trial period =

Add a trial period to the plans. For example, 14 - day free trial. This is a great way to get the customer to sign up. The customer will be automatically charged after 14 days.
You don't have to move a muscle. Let Axis subscriptions handle it for you.

= Content restriction / dripping (PRO Version only) =

Not so familiar with what this is ? Don't worry. It is just restricting the content depending on the membership level. Let us say, you are taking a membership for your theatre club and have three levels of members: Students, Adults, Family. You may have specific content for each group in your website.
You may want to allow members of the Student group to see only the content related to them. Similarly, each group should have access to specific content.
That is where the Axis Memberships and Subscriptions helps you do it. Effortlessly.

= Handle cancellations =
You can allow members to cancel their subscription / membership anytime. They can send the cancellation request from their profile page. It is that simple.

= Coupons / Discounts =

Provide discounts. Promote your membership plans with a coupon. It can be either percentage or a fixed discount on the membership plans.

= Manage members / subscribers =

Manage all your members / subscribers in one neat page. Add / edit / remove members. You can also add / edit details to their subscription.

= Member emails / notifications =

Send an email notification for various events. Example, emails can be sent when a subscription is created, updated, payment completion, cancellation, update etc.
You can customize the emails and their content easily.
